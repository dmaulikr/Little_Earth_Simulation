# Little_Earth_Simulation
_Herbivores, Carnivores, and Plants. See who survives._
---
You define the size of the Earth (an N x N grid) and how many cycles you want to observe.

The animals roam the map. Herbivores look for plants to eat and run away from Carnivores.
Carnivores hunt the herbivores. 

Plants vary in energy. Herbivores get that random energy when they eat a plant, and 
Carnivores get the energy of the specific Herbivore they consume also.

Each animal has varying age, life maximum, speed, birth age, hunger threshold, sight, and more.

This was a small evolving project to practice OO principles
